# AndroidStarterAlt
A sample Android app using the MVP architecture.

Compare to the <https://github.com/RoRoche/AndroidStarter> repository, this one uses:

* [requery](https://github.com/requery/requery/) as persistence layer
* [EventBus](https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus) as event bus layer
* [LoganSquare](https://github.com/bluelinelabs/LoganSquare) as JSON parsing layer
* [Conductor](https://github.com/bluelinelabs/Conductor) to build View-based Android applications

It allowed me to write less code and delete some classes written in the <https://github.com/RoRoche/AndroidStarter> repository.
